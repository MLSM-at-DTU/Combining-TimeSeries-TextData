On this day at the edge of time, in this place of all possibilities, begins an inspired incantation to life rediscovered. The word Varekai means "wherever" in the Romany language of the gypsies the universal wanderers. This production pays tribute to the nomadic soul, to the spirit and art of the circus tradition, and to the infinite passion of those whose quest takes them along the path that leads to Varekai.

Deep within a forest, at the summit of a volcano, exists an extraordinary world - a world where something else is possible. A world called Varekai.

Parachuted into the shadows of a magical forest, a kaleidoscopic world populated by fantastical creatures, this young man sets off on an adventure both absurd and extraordinary. On this day at the edge of time, in this place of all possibilities, begins an inspired incantation to life rediscovered. The word Varekai means "wherever" in the Romany language of the gypsies the universal wanderers. This production pays tribute to the nomadic soul, to the spirit and art of the circus tradition, and to the infinite passion of those whose quest takes them along the path that leads to Varekai.

After 11 years of touring the world under the blue and yellow Big Top, Varekai begun a new adventure this past December touring the world in arenas. Deep within a forest, at the summit of a volcano, exists an extraordinary world - a world where something else is possible. A world called Varekai. From the sky falls a solitary young man, and the story of Varekai begins. Parachuted into the shadows of a magical forest, a kaleidoscopic world populated by fantastical creatures, this young man sets off on an adventure both absurd and extraordinary. On this day at the edge of time, in this place of all possibilities, begins an inspired incantation to life rediscovered. The word Varekai means "wherever" in the Romany language of the gypsies the universal wanderers. This production pays tribute to the nomadic soul, to the spirit and art of the circus tradition, and to the infinite passion of those whose quest takes them along the path that leads to Varekai.

On this day at the edge of time, in this place of all possibilities, begins an inspired incantation to life rediscovered. The word Varekai means "wherever" in the Romany language of the gypsies the universal wanderers. This production pays tribute to the nomadic soul, to the spirit and art of the circus tradition, and to the infinite passion of those whose quest takes them along the path that leads to Varekai.

2013-10-19 19:30	Pearl Jam	http://www.barclayscenter.com/events/detail/pearl-jam	Pearl Jam will be performing two nights at Barclays Center on October 18 and 19 at 7:30PM, in what will be the bands only New York City area appearance on its current tour. Doors will open at 6:30PM. There is not an opening act for either show and the concert is expected to start on time. In 1991, Pearl Jam's debut album, Ten, catapulted the little-known Seattle-based band into superstardom. Nine studio albums, hundreds of unique live performances and hundreds of official live concert bootleg releases later, the band continue to be critically acclaimed and commercially successful -- with over 60 million albums sold worldwide. Over the past twenty years, the band has remained a major force in rock and roll, as much for its aggressive loyalty to its social and political principles and restless experimentation as for its rock radio staples and bestselling albums.

2016-07-30 20:00	Battle for Brooklyn	http://www.barclayscenter.com/events/detail/battle-for-brooklyn	Former two-division world champion Paulie Malignaggi of Bensonhurst is set to defend Brooklyns World Championship Belt on Saturday, July 30 in a 10-round welterweight showdown after being challenged on Twitter by fellow Brooklyn-native Gabriel Bracero of Sunset Park.       A video posted by Gabriel Tito Bracero (@team_bracero) on Jul 13, 2016 at 11:30am PDT     Malignaggi earned the title of King of Brooklyn when he defeated another Brooklyn-born star in former world champion Zab Judah in December of 2013 at Barclays Center. This version of the Battle for Brooklyn will once again have local bragging rights on the line, with both men looking to impress in front of a hometown crowd.   I already won one #BrooklynBattle. Gonna do it again July 30. I accept the challenge, @TeamBracero. @Brooklyn_Boxing pic.twitter.com/imZJG75nzV  Paul Malignaggi (@PaulMalignaggi) July 13, 2016   As a fellow Brooklynite, BROOKLYN BOXING would like to extend to you a special offer to see the Battle for Brooklyn live at Barclays Center. This special offer includes:  4-PACK OF TICKETS on select seats $20 food & beverage credit to use on the day of the event One (1) complimentary Brooklyn Boxing Merchandise T-shirt Use code: BROOKLYN   Buy Tickets Now  Representing Brooklyn with this belt has been something Im very proud of, said Malignaggi. I relish the competitive spirit of being able to defend it against another quality Brooklyn fighter like Gabriel Bracero. I fight for Brooklyn and I represent Brooklyn with everything Ive got each time I step into the ring and on July 30 it will be no different. This fight is going to have two Brooklynites, finally meeting inside the ring, in a really exciting matchup, said Bracero. What better way to highlight that, then having the Brooklyns World Championship Belt on the line. Growing up in Brooklyn is what has made me the man and the fighter that I am today. I respect Paulie for giving me this opportunity, for putting his belt on the line and everything hes done in his career. On July 30 though, that belt is coming home with me. I will be the new champion of Brooklyn. Malignaggi-Bracero figures not only to be a highly competitive fight, but is truly a battle of Brooklyn, said Lou DiBella, President of DiBella Entertainment. Paulie has had a fantastic career, but this is a dangerous matchup for him against a tough fighter. Theres nothing more fitting than two Brooklyn fighters, Paulie, of Bensonhurst, and Gabriel, of Sunset Park, standing toe-to-toe in the ring at Barclays Center, said Brett Yormark, CEO of Brooklyn Sports & Entertainment. Paulie holds the title of Brooklyns World Champion. On July 30, his belt is on the line. Whos going to take it? The July 30 event features a SHOWTIME CHAMPIONSHIP BOXING card headlined by a featherweight world title clash between Leo Santa Cruz and Carl Frampton. The event also features former two-division world champion Mikey Garcia returning to the ring to take on former champion Elio Rojas, plus 154-pound contenders Tony Harrison and Sergey Rabchenko in a world title-eliminator, and a battle of lightweight sluggers in Ivan Redkach and Tevin Farmer. A former world champion at 140 and 147-pounds, the 35-year-old Malignaggi (35-7, 7 KOs) will return to the ring to fight at Barclays Center for the fifth time. He has faced a slew of big names throughout his career and has been victorious over the likes of Judah, Vyacheslav Senchenko and Pablo Cesar Cano. The Magic Man was victorious twice fighting in his birth country of Italy last year after unsuccessfully challenging unbeaten Danny Garcia in August. Bracero (24-2, 5 KOs) comes off of a sensational one-punch knockout of rival Danny OConnor in their rematch last October. The 35-year-old owns victories over Dmitry Salita and Pavel Miranda in addition to his first triumph over the previously unbeaten OConnor in 2011.

This will be the bands first show in Brooklyn since performing in July 2010 in Prospect Park. Youth Lagoon is set to open the show.  Formed in 1999, The National consists of vocalist Matt Berninger fronting two pairs of brothers: Aaron (guitar, bass, piano) and Bryce Dessner (guitar), and Scott (bass, guitar) and Bryan Devendorf (drums). Their first full-length albums, The National, Sad Songs For Dirty Lovers, and a crucial mini-album, Cherry Tree, preceded their signing to label Beggars Banquet in 2004. Alligator (2005), included underground anthem Mr. November, and raised their profile as The National grew into an incendiary live band. Boxer (2007), featuring songs like Fake Empire, Mistaken For Strangers and Start A War, sold over three times as many copies as its predecessor and saw them transformed from underground stars into a rock institution. High Violet (2010), released on 4AD brought the band global critical and commercial success. Both individually and collectively, The Nationals members have been involved in countless artistic, charitable, and socio-political pursuits.

Airing LIVE from Barclays Center on Sunday, August 25, this years Video Music Awards will mark the 30th anniversary of the show and become the first major annual award show to take place in the borough of Brooklyn.   From a vibrant musical scene for up and coming artists to epic concerts by today's biggest stars and the triumphant return of pro sports to the borough after nearly 60 years, Brooklyn has re-emerged as a cultural capitol where music, sports and entertainment history is made every day, said Stephen Friedman, President of MTV. We cant wait to help write the next chapter on August 25th, when one of the biggest nights in music happens in Brooklyn for the very first time.   Brooklyn is home to icons like the Cyclone in Coney Island and the Brooklyn Bridge, and now it can lay claim to the MTV Video Music Awards, said Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. Bringing the VMAs to Brooklyn will mean hundreds of jobs as crews work on the production and provide a boost to our local economy as attendees stay in hotels, visit local eateries and experience all Brooklyn and our City have to offer.   MTVs Video Music Awards are the perfect culmination to an incredible inaugural year for Barclays Center, said Brett Yormark, CEO of Barclays Center. The VMAs are a symbol of pop culture and have created iconic moments worldwide in music and entertainment. Brooklyn has become an international brand and is the perfect setting for these moments. We cant wait to share our stage with the world.   From hip-hop to hipsters, JAY Z to MGMT, Brooklyn musicians have a long history of dominating the spotlight on MTV. Brooklyn is a cultural Meccathe hippest, coolest place for young people across the country, and has played a crucial role in the careers of some of 2013s biggest bands, like Fun and the Lumineers, stated Brooklyn Borough President Marty Markowitz. Now, it is only fitting that the first time Brooklyn will ever host a major awards show, we are welcoming the most exciting and talked about spectacle in the music industry: the MTV Video Music Awards. What better venue than the newest, most beautiful, most state-of-the-art arena in the country, Barclays Center. Bravo to MTV on a decision that hits all the right notes and strikes all the right chords. Im so thrilled that Ill probably get no sleep till Brooklyn hosts the VMAs!   Since the first MTV Video Music Awards aired in 1984, the VMAs instantly earned its reputation for delivering the most popular bands and artists to create the loudest, most influential and at times, the most controversial, annual live celebration of music in the world. No other award show has been responsible for creating more memorable or bigger musical moments in pop culture history than the MTV Video Music Awards. From Madonna, Michael Jackson, Guns N Roses and Nirvana to Britney Spears, Taylor Swift, Beyonc and Kanye West, an appearance on the VMA stage can forever change the trajectory of an artists career in one single night.   The 2013 MTV Video Music Awards will air across MTVs global network of more than 60 channels reaching more than a half-billion households around the world as well as through syndication. In addition, its convergent programming and content will reach the entire interactive community, via MTVs more than 200 digital media properties around the world.

Supporting their new album release, the band will bring their Revolution Radio Tour to Barclays Center on March 15. Green Day's new album, Revolution Radio, is a collection of songs about the chaotic state of America in 2016. Its not strictly a political concept album like American Idiot  there are also more-personal songs like "Ordinary World," a sweet ballad that ends the album. But most songs touch on pressing social issues: "Still Breathing" is a scorcher that, according to Armstrong, "goes from the life of a junkie to the life of a gambler to the life of a single mother and a soldier and how were all kinda intertwined." The most incendiary song is lead single "Bang Bang," written from the perspective of a mass shooter. For information on individual suites, please click here or call 718.257.8483.

2013-10-09 20:00	Rodriguez	http://www.barclayscenter.com/events/detail/rodriguez-1	Resurgent troubadour Rodriguez  the subject of the Academy Award-winning documentary, Searching for Sugar Man  is performing at Barclays Center on Wednesday, October 9 at 8PM. The concert at Cushman & Wakefield Theater at Barclays Center continues one of the most remarkable musical comebacks in recent memory on Rodriguezs wildly popular U.S. tour itinerary. Support acts for Rodriguez will be Sandra Rodriguez, Susan Coswill and John Sinclair. At the dawn of the 1970s, singer-songwriter Sixto Rodrguez, the Detroit-bred son of Mexican immigrants, released the albums Cold Fact and Coming from Reality, filled with uncompromising yet graceful folk-rock songs depicting poverty, missed opportunities, and inner-city life. The albums gained little attention at the time, and Rodriguez eventually drifted away from music. Unbeknownst to Rodriguez, bootleg copies of his albums had made him a platinum-level star in South Africa, where his raw, topical songs made him a folk hero in the fight against apartheidas well as the subject of numerous rumors, including one that he'd committed suicide. Two South African fans, eager to separate fact from myth, embarked on an investigation to find out what really happened to Rodriguez. Their search became the foundation for Searching for Sugar Man, which has won international acclaim from critics, film festivals and from viewers, who have embraced Rodriguez's unique songs and inspirational story. Rodriguez's surprise resurgence has inspired a return to live performance for the artist, who has played to rapturous concert crowds in several major cities, as well as on The Late Show with David Letterman, Tonight Show with Jay Leno and in feature stories on his unlikely comeback on 60 Minutes and CNN.
